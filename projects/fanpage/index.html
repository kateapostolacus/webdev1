            <p class=teaa>I am a big fan of tea. I am really into green teas, but all teas will do. I am no coffee girl, I am a tea girl. Hot or iced, sweet or unsweet,  tea is always there for me. That's why I try to drink tea at least once a day. You should see my tea collection, it is really something.</p>

            <p class=tget>There are few places in this world that make me feel at peace. Target is one of those places. Retail therapy takes another form when it comes to Target. Literal love of my life, I think I can survive the apocolypse as long as Target is still up and running. Thank you Target. </p>
