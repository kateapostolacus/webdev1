    <header>Day 1</header>
    <day1>For our first day in Italy, on June 13th, I fly into Rome around 1pm.<br> Once I arrive in Rome, my first excursion will be getting to our Airbnb, <br>and maybe getting a pizza and a drink. Then around 5pm, my best friend <br> Sabina's flight will get in from America. We will get settled in then go out <br> for the night at a local restaurant and club.

    <header>Day 2</header>
    <day2> Day 2 is touring day as we will wake up and make a small breakfast,<br> then begin our tourist things. Starting at Campidoglio, Foro Romano, <br> Colosseum, MACRO museum, and Porto Pia. Around Porto Pia is <br> where we will get lunch. After lunch we will hit up the Trevi Fountain, <br> Spanish Steps, and end with Villa Medici. We will go back to the Airbnb <br>and refresh before dinner and then ending the night with Lizzie Maguire.

    <header>Day 3</header>
    <day3>Day 3 is next and we are heading to the Vatican City. The Vatican <br> is home to the Sistine Chapel and is one of the smallest countries. <br> After we explore the Vatican, we will then head to the neighboring <br> Trastevere area. This area was recommened to me by my cousin <br> who studied abroad in Rome. While in Trastevere, we will stop by <br> the Giardino del Teatro, which are gardens in Rome. Lastly, if we still <br> have energy, we will hit the town at night for clubbing.

    <header>Day 4</header>
    <day4>Day 4 is our last full day in Italy and we are thinking of an excursion <br> to either the beach or Pompeii. The beach we are thinking of Il Gabbiano <br> which is a nice beach. We could also go to Pompeii but that is a bit of a <br> trek, and I get carsick. After our day of excursions, the night will include <br> a chill night in packing and getting ready for the next day.
    </day4>
    <header>Day 5</header>
    <day5>For our final moments in Italy, it is time for us to say goodbye to our <br> Italian adventure. Sabina and I will be flying from Rome to Lisbon for <br> our 4 hour layover and then off to New Jersey where I will reunite with <br> my dad and friends from home!
