    <day8>For my first day back in Jersey, per tradition, the first order of business <br> is to get a bagel. Once those matters are taken care of, it is time to meet<br> up with my friends. I only get to see my hometown friends once or twice <br> a year so we make sure those moments count.</day8>

    <day9> June 19th happens to be Father's Day, and I will conveniently be staying <br> with my dad. On Father's Day (since I will be legal) I can't wait to <br> take him out for once and do all the things that dads enjoy doing. My dad <br> really enjoys biking, bowling, and breweries.</day9>

    <day10>Being from New Jersey, I do happen to have close proximity to New York City. <br> After growing up in New Jersey, I also have a lot of friends that go to school <br> in the city as well, including my best friend, Emma. On Monday, we are thinking <br> of heading into the city so she can show me all her favorite spots. </day10>
<header>June 21st- Day 4</header>
    <day11>I totally forgot to mention I live right near the beach, so Day 4 will be a beach <br> day! Growing up living next to the beach was awesome, especially towards <br> the end of the school year when we were able to go to the beach after school. <br> I still have a lot of friends that work at the beach. Did you know you have to pay <br> to get on the beach in New Jersey? It's what I deserve since I don't know how to pump gas. </day11>
<header>June 22nd- Day 5</header>
    <day12>This is my last day in Jersey until who knows, but more importantly a travel day. <br> Emma and I are going to meeet our friends up at Rutgers University before I <br> hop on a train for my next adventure in Virginia.</day12>
