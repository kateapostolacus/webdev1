    <header>June 22th- Day 1</header>
    <day13>On this day, I will arrive at night into Charlottesville, Virginia. This is <br> not only where the University of Viginia is located, but is also where <br> my mom lives. This first night I hope to get settled and probably do <br> some laundry. </day13>

    <header>June 23 - June 25</header>
    <day14>These few days are the ones that I am going to spend with my mom. <br> We are going to hang out, maybe get our nails done, and get food <br> together. Maybe one day we will go to DC, but it may be a trek.</day14>

    <header>June 25 - July 2</header>
    <day15>For these days, I will be enjoying the beach with my family in Virginia <br> Beach. I haven't seen my family since Thanksgiving since I had COVID <br> over Christmas. Some of my family members I haven't seen since 2019. <br> I can't wait to see them, especially my Yaya, and spend some time together. </day15>
